## Real Time Seizure Detection using EEG
We downsample the EEG signals from the [TUH EEG dataset](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/), and extract features. The models detect whether ictal / non-ictal signal appears within the 4-second sliding window input. We present an example case with Raw EEG signal but other signal feature extractors can also be applied in the pipeline.
